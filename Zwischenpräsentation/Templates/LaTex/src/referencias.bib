abstract="The internet of things (IoT) is a huge network of heterogeneous devices; sensors and actuators, which provide a better world of services such as smart cities, smart grid, health care, smart agriculture and so on. This novel concept represents a rich area of research challenges. Instead, the most important aspects of the IoT networks are security and privacy. Because of the potential augmentation of IoT devices number and their limitations in terms of computational power, energy and memory, those aspects become more and more difficult to be established. This chapter consists of an exhaustive study about IoT applications and security in such environment. Hence, we present IoT deployment issues and the existent attacks on IoT environment considering the IoT layers. Then, we discuss the requirement of IoT security as well as the actual solutions for remediation of the compromised security, such as authentication protocols, intrusion detection systems and machine learning.",

ABSTRACT = {Recent advances in hardware and information technology have accelerated the proliferation of smart and interconnected devices facilitating the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT applications and services are widely adopted in environments such as smart cities, smart industry, autonomous vehicles, and eHealth. As such, IoT devices are ubiquitously connected, transferring sensitive and personal data without requiring human interaction. Consequently, it is crucial to preserve data privacy. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent Machine Learning (ML)- and Deep Learning (DL)-based solutions for privacy in IoT. First, we present an in depth analysis of current privacy threats and attacks. Then, for each ML architecture proposed, we present the implementations, details, and the published results. Finally, we identify the most effective solutions for the different threats and attacks.},

abstract = {Home is a person's castle, a private and protected space. Internet-connected devices such as locks, cameras, and speakers might make a home "smarter" but also raise privacy issues because these devices may constantly and inconspicuously collect, infer or even share information about people in the home. To explore user-centered privacy designs for smart homes, we conducted a co-design study in which we worked closely with diverse groups of participants in creating new designs. This study helps fill the gap in the literature between studying users' privacy concerns and designing privacy tools only by experts. Our participants' privacy designs often relied on simple strategies, such as data localization, disconnection from the Internet, and a private mode. From these designs, we identified six key design factors: data transparency and control, security, safety, usability and user experience, system intelligence, and system modality. We discuss how these factors can guide design for smart home privacy.},

ABSTRACT = {Privacy and security are among the significant challenges of the Internet of Things (IoT). Improper device updates, lack of efficient and robust security protocols, user unawareness, and famous active device monitoring are among the challenges that IoT is facing. In this work, we are exploring the background of IoT systems and security measures, and identifying (a) different security and privacy issues, (b) approaches used to secure the components of IoT-based environments and systems, (c) existing security solutions, and (d) the best privacy models necessary and suitable for different layers of IoT driven applications. In this work, we proposed a new IoT layered model: generic and stretched with the privacy and security components and layers identification. The proposed cloud/edge supported IoT system is implemented and evaluated. The lower layer represented by the IoT nodes generated from the Amazon Web Service (AWS) as Virtual Machines. The middle layer (edge) implemented as a Raspberry Pi 4 hardware kit with support of the Greengrass Edge Environment in AWS. We used the cloud-enabled IoT environment in AWS to implement the top layer (the cloud). The security protocols and critical management sessions were between each of these layers to ensure the privacy of the users&rsquo; information. We implemented security certificates to allow data transfer between the layers of the proposed cloud/edge enabled IoT model. Not only is the proposed system model eliminating possible security vulnerabilities, but it also can be used along with the best security techniques to countermeasure the cybersecurity threats facing each one of the layers; cloud, edge, and IoT.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming an important factor in many areas of our society. IoT brings intelligence to critical aspects like transportation, industry, payments, health and many others. The interaction between embedded devices and Cloud based web services is a common scenario of IoT deployment. From the security point of view, both users and smart devices must establish a secure communication channel and have a form of digital identity. Most of the times, the usage of IoT devices requires an already existing infrastructure which cannot be controlled by the device owner, for instance in a smart home. This scenario requires a security stack suitable for heterogeneous devices which can be integrated in already existing operating systems or IoT frameworks. This paper proposes a lightweight authorization stack for smart-home IoT applications, where a Cloud-connected device relays input commands to a user’s smart-phone for authorization. This architecture is user-device centric and addresses security issues in the context of an untrusted Cloud platform.}

ABSTRACT = {Often the Internet of Things (IoT) is considered as a single problem domain, with proposed solutions intended to be applied across a wide range of applications. However, the privacy and security needs of critical engineering infrastructure or sensitive commercial operations are very different to the needs of a domestic Smart Home environment. Additionally, the financial and human resources available to implement security and privacy vary greatly between application domains. In domestic environments, human issues may be as important as technical issues. After surveying existing solutions for enhancing IoT security, the paper identifies key future requirements for trusted Smart Home systems. A gateway architecture is selected as the most appropriate for resource-constrained devices, and for high system availability. Two key technologies to assist system auto-management are identified. Firstly, support for system auto-configuration will enhance system security. Secondly, the automatic update of system software and firmware is needed to maintain ongoing secure system operation.},
