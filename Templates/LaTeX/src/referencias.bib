ABSTRACT = {Recent advances in hardware and information technology have accelerated the proliferation of smart and interconnected devices facilitating the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT applications and services are widely adopted in environments such as smart cities, smart industry, autonomous vehicles, and eHealth. As such, IoT devices are ubiquitously connected, transferring sensitive and personal data without requiring human interaction. Consequently, it is crucial to preserve data privacy. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent Machine Learning (ML)- and Deep Learning (DL)-based solutions for privacy in IoT. First, we present an in depth analysis of current privacy threats and attacks. Then, for each ML architecture proposed, we present the implementations, details, and the published results. Finally, we identify the most effective solutions for the different threats and attacks.},

abstract = {The era of the Internet of Things (IoT) has already started and it will profoundly change our way of life. While IoT provides us many valuable benefits, IoT also exposes us to many different types of security threats in our daily life. Before the advent of IoT, most security threats were just related to information leakage and the loss of service. With IoT, security threats have become closely related to our non-virtual lives and they can directly influence physical security risk.The Internet of Things consists of various platforms and devices with different capabilities, and each system will need security solutions depending on its characteristics. There is a demand for security solutions that are able to support multi-profile platforms and provide equivalent security levels for various device interactions. In addition, user privacy will become more important in the IoT environment because a lot of personal information will be delivered and shared among connected things. Therefore, we need mechanisms to protect personal data and monitor their flow from things to the cloud. In this talk, we describe threats and concerns for security and privacy arising from IoT services, and introduce approaches to solve these security and privacy issues in the industrial field.},

ABSTRACT = {Along with the growing threat of cyberattacks, cybersecurity has become one of the most important areas of the Internet of Things (IoT). The purpose of IoT cybersecurity is to reduce cybersecurity risk for organizations and users through the protection of IoT assets and privacy. New cybersecurity technologies and tools provide potential for better IoT security management. However, there is a lack of effective IoT cyber risk management frameworks for managers. This paper reviews IoT cybersecurity technologies and cyber risk management frameworks. Then, this paper presents a four-layer IoT cyber risk management framework. This paper also applies a linear programming method for the allocation of financial resources to multiple IoT cybersecurity projects. An illustration is provided as a proof of concept.},
